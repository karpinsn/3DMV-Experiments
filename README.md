3DMV-Experiments
================

Repository for all of the various small experiments that I run in the 3D Machine Vision Lab.

Most of the stuff that you will find here is probably poorly commented and named, along with having very minimal testing. These are simply one off experiments that are used to check small hypothesis during my work in the 3DMV lab. If you have questions about them feel free to ask questions, and hopefully this information will be useful to someone.
